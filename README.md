## Dataset: ##

## Problem Statement ##
- Financial institutions face two critical challenges simultaneously: minimizing losses from fraudulent transactions and maximizing revenue by assigning accurate credit limits.
- Manual review is unscalable, and static rules often fail to capture complex behavioral patterns.

## Goal: ##
We are developing a dual-model machine learning system to enhance decision-making in real-time:

## Fraud Detection (Classification): ##
- Goal: Instantly flag transactions as "Fraudulent" or "Legitimate."
- Method: Utilizing transaction metadata, user history, and card features to identify anomalies.

## Credit Limit Optimization (Regression): ##
- Goal: Predict the optimal credit limit for each user.
- Method: Analyzing financial behavior and demographics to balance risk with customer purchasing power.

## Research Questions: ##
1. How can we classify whether a transaction is fraudulent based on user information, card attributes, merchant data, and transaction behavior?
2. How can we accurately predict credit limits for cardholders based on their financial behavior, demographics, and transaction patterns?

## Objectives: ##
1. To develop a machine learning model to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using transaction, card, and user features.
2. To build a regression model to predict appropriate credit limits for cardholders based on financial behavior, demographics, and transaction patterns.

## Key Impact: ##
1. Reduces financial loss from fraud.
2. Enhances customer experience by automatically offering appropriate credit limits.
